ToDoList Application

Features:
- Creating tasks and projects
- Adding dueDates and priorities to tasks
- Sorting tasks by priority and dueDate
- Showing tasks for today and this week
- Responsive

What I have learned:
- Usage of Classes / Object oriented programing
- get / set functions
- creating dates and formating / using functions with date-fns
- Building a context Menu ( includes only a delete feature yet)
- DOM Manipulation
- CSS styling and responsiveness
